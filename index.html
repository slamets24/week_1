            <h2>Hi Selamat datang di CV Saya</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am Slamet Setiawan born in September 2000 on the 12th. My background does not have IT or coding skills but I am very
            enthusiastic about this world, I wanted to appear when I was in 3rd grade junior high school at that time I made
            articles on websites using blogger even though I can still see the contents from other articles, but I am very happy to
            know that the website was not made with just plain words, there is also a program on it. Unfortunately I was not
            accepted into the IT or RPL major during SMK but I was accepted at the Industrial Automation major, what is that? a
            major that combines several majors from mechanical engineering, IT, building drawings, electrical engineering, and
            electricity. Even though I didn't enter the major that I wanted, I enjoyed following it because there was a program
            language there too. At least that's all my story was 8 years ago. now I start again from scratch. Thank You</p>
